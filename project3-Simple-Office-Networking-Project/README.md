Design a network in CISCO packet tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments throght the following:
a.  Each department shoud container at least 2 PCs.
b.  Appropriate number of switchesnd routrs shluludl be used in the network.
c.  Using the given network address 192.168.40.0, all interfaces should be configured with appropriate IP address, subnet mask and gateways.
d.  All devicess in the network should be conncted using appropriate cables.
e.  Test the connectivity between ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY department -PCs in DELIVERY department should be able to ping the PCs in ACCOUNTS department.
